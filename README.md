Duckworth is a Semi-automated platform that optimizes energy usage and cost savings based on historical consumption and weather forecasting.

We focused on a specific solution to the Duck Problem:

The duck curve is a problem to the consumer and grid operator -- as the solar industry continues to grow we will start to see large surges or spikes in power being pulled from the grid after the sun sets. This can be costly for Time of Use customers as well as an unecessary stress to the grid having to ramp-up so quickly. 

Using tools such at Sunrun's power usage data, we were able to analyze anonymized energy usage and production for residential customers that have solar PV and battery storage systems. We utilized the Darksky API to look at weather forecasting and Highchart.js to visualize the data. On the back end we used Python, mySQL, Docker and Pandas to sort, index and analyze the data. For the frontend, we used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Highcharts.js. 

We built a customer portal prototype for Sunrun users to look at their energy consumption, savings, and a gamification component that involves incentivizing customers with DuckBucks.

Don't forget: with our portal customers, you can gain DuckBucks to use trade, mine, and redeem for various energy services. This is just another way to engage customers by making saving energy fun!!
